Okay then, wanna hear,
I just wanna tell you a little story this little story
That my daddy used to tell me he was a king as
Well i was born, probably about 68 years ago over by
That tree over there yeh
And i remember things changed a lot in those
Days, in madagascar it wasnt so commercial, you know,
There wasnt all the fuss bout who's got the latest tree
And what leaves
Are you wearing and who's got
The latest fur on their back you know,
Those days it was just me and a couple of the others you
Know, doing the jungle boogie you know,
Jungle boogie... Jungle boogie
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
I like to move it!
You really think this is never gonna end coz it is 3,2,1
Not bad eh? I like it
